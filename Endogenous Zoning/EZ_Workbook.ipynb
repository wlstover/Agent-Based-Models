There is also a `DevelopTag` agent defined in a separate class, which is used to store and update information on the grid tiles themselves that represent property. Finally, there are miscellaneous functions that do not belong to any class that are usually used to query information about the model directly for the purposes of reporting and analysis (for instance, `get_Regulations`).

Whenever you see an empty list, that usually means that it's something *dynamic* that changes over the course of the model and will be kept track of here - these are usually important variables to know about. The comments should provide enough information about all these variables - just remember the principle that these variables will get called either inside this class, in which case you'll see it demaracated as `self.x`, or outside of it when we're trying to access these variables inside an instantiation of the class, in which case you'll see it as, for example, `zm.x`, where `zm` is the name of the variable holding that instantiation.\n",
